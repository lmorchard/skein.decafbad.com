“Warning: Consumption of beverages produced by this machine may counteract community-mandated tranquility agents introduced by municipal drinking water treatment.”

Mark found the transparent and still-tacky sticker upside-down on the counter next to the coffee maker. Looking up, he could see a clean spot on the machine’s stainless-steel casing, where the past few years’ worth of accumulated crud abruptly stopped. He scratched his head: He’d never seen warnings on the machine before now.

He finished the last sip of the best cup he’d ever brewed — and startled himself with a spontaneous yawp.

Just then, jack-booted thugs burst through his door.
