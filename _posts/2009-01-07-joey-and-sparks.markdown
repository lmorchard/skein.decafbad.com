Under a full moon, Joey the Super Baby and his canine sidekick Sparks stood together on a skyscraper ledge, surveying the great city spread out before them. Their keen eyes found nothing but scenes of peaceful citizens going about their happy lives.

But then, the preternaturally intelligent Welsh Corgi barked twice, trademark lightning leaping in his eyes. The toddler squealed with delight and the duo dove from their perch to streak across the urban skyline. Scattered car alarms at street level cried out in surprise at the sudden sonic booms.

In seconds, they reached the scene of the crime.

* * *

Officer Jones had just arrived at the convenience store, responding to a report of an attempted robbery. According to dispatch, the store owner had shot out the tall guy’s kneecaps and the shorter one had just pissed himself and fainted. Really, it was all over beyond calling an ambulance and filling out a report.

That was, of course, until Joey and Sparks showed up.

Joey the Super Baby struck the sidewalk in front of the convenience store like a meteor. The landing blew out a crater a few feet deep, the shockwave and wash of debris shattering windows and battering parked cars.

“Jesus fuck,” said Officer Jones as he ducked behind his squad car.

Sparks arrived a heartbeat later, the little flying Welsh Corgi throwing off a spidery plasma-ball of electrical arcs that set power lines aflame and burst streetlights in his wake.

Jones’ shelter was abruptly gone, as Joey toddled over to grab the man’s Crown Vic by the frame. Giggling, he hurled it into the storefront. In mid-flight, Sparks cast a stream of electricity at the rear of the car, igniting the gas tank and setting off an explosion inside the building.

Jones was flung across the street, mercifully clear of flame and shrapnel. Nothing must’ve been broken – he was running before he realized it, fleeing down an alley as the pair demolished the block behind him.

“I need backup!” screamed the policeman into his radio.
