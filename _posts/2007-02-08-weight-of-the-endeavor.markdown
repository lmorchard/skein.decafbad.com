I've posted a couple bits of my incomplete draft for [The Juggler](http://decafbad.com/skein/category/thejuggler/) so far, and I think I'm probably about 1/2 way through.   I'm wondering if that's what I should be doing.  The story's not finished, not edited, and I don't quite know how it's going to end yet.  But, I feel like I need to instantiate this stuff somewhere earlier than later, in order to help it drag me through to finishing it.

Of course, I haven't actually told anyone about this slush pile yet, so it's not as if I expect anyone but an accidental visitor.  I am tempted to toss a link to someone soon to get some premature opinions on what I've written.  Not sure if that's a mistake or not.

Basically, my problem is that I keep putting my writing on pedestals.  Not in that I think I'm the best ever, just that *Writing is a Great Pursuit for Me*.  I've been doing it for a long time, with varying degrees of success, and I consider it something *I Want to Do*.  Other things that I've *Wanted to Do* include: Finding a girl exactly like my wife and marrying her (check), writing a book and getting it published (check, check), moving to California to be a Computer Scientist (check).  Pretty big things, and there are more, but I've not done too shabby at accomplishing them so far.

Problem is, all this puts a great pressure on me when I face a blank page and feel the *Weight of the Endeavor*.

Realistically, I know that I haven't written fiction in awhile.  So, despite my having perhaps some passable or even good skill at writing in general, 90% of what I'm going to write story-wise will be crap.  It'll need reworking and editing and feedback from readers.  And though in one cranial lobe I recognize that, the perfectionist side expects me to spin gold immediately.  

The thing is, though I think that I _can_ turn crap into gold eventually, it'll take metric fucktons of crap produced repeatedly over a long period of time.  And more importantly, although that one cranial lobe considers that *Every Story Idea is Precious*, the other lobe can admit that even many of my ideas are crap.  And, at this stage at least, I'll probably butcher even the ideas that _are_ good.

Hmm.  That all sounds horribly depressing, doesn't it?  Why bother?  Well, mostly, because this is something I've always wanted to do and something I figure I can be half-way decent at with some work.

And, then, there's this *skein*.  Why's it here?  Well, mostly, so I can subject some other poor saps to my metric fucktons of crap and get their feedback eventually.  Hopefully it entertains, at some point.  I'd also like to get beat down a bit early and often so as not to get too precious with this stuff.  I suspect I'll have a tendency to do so, thanks to all my pedestal building and *Capitalized Phrases of Importance*.
