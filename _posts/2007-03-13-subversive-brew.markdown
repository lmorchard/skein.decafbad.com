<i>A writing prompt borrowed from [http://100wordstories.com/2007/03/12/](http://100wordstories.com/2007/03/12/):</i>

<i>You go into your kitchen in the morning and there's a note next to your coffee maker. What does it say?</i>

"Warning:  Consumption of beverages produced by this machine may counteract community-mandated tranquility agents introduced by municipal drinking water treatment."

Mark found the transparent and still-tacky sticker upside-down on the counter next to the coffee maker.  Looking up, he could see a clean spot on the machine's stainless-steel casing, where the past few years' worth of accumulated crud abruptly stopped.  He scratched his head:  He'd never seen warnings on the machine before now.

He finished the last sip of the best cup he'd ever brewed â€” and startled himself with a spontaneous yawp.

Just then, jack-booted thugs burst through his door.
