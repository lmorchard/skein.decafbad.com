“Do you remember the first time you were badly hurt?”

“Not really. Don’t we all experience our share of scrapes and bruises in childhood?”

“No, that’s not what I mean. Have you ever suffered an injury of such severity that you were left less capable than you were before? One that took weeks or months to heal?”

“Oh, I see. Yes. I broke my leg once, back in college. We were drunk and where we shouldn’t’ve been. I fell off our dorm roof.”

“Do you take risks like that anymore, just for fun?”

“No, I’m too old for that sort of thing these days.”

“When did you first think of yourself as too old?”

“Hmm. I can’t really say—though, I think I see your point.”

“Do you? Tell me, then: Why are we not drunk on a rooftop tonight?”

“Because I’ve been diminished that way before and I fear repeating the experience.”

“Surely you realize that, though ancient, we are no longer so frail and easily harmed?”

“Yes, but the lesson remains a part of me and informs my decisions.”

“Just so. Thus are we rendered unadventurous.”
