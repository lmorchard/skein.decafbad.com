The hiveminded, phosphorescent lichen are conspiring with the mechanized saurans in low earth orbit. They share a common conception of the color blue, at odds with the occluded vision of the mad pachiderms.

They plan to bombard the elephants’ capital city in India with M&M-shaped tofu blobs–an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second per second from orbit can pack quite a punch. The blobs will first have been electroplated in platinum, using the saurans’ wireless electricity. This should help with the stresses of atmospheric reentry.

Anyway, I don’t know what’s up with Esther or construction workers. Does she like waffles and eyepatches?
