After a somewhat unintentional hiatus, I got back to some writing tonight - specifically for the [Alpha vs Delta][avd] fanfic I started here.  I'm about 1500 words into Part III, which I think makes it a little under half-way done.  Finally switching to the Triangles' point of view here and mixing things up a bit with a new character entering the mess.  Hopefully I'll have the next installment posted here within the next day or so, and then try to commit to getting the rest of the installments out within a week of each other.

Update (03/08/2007): Got a few more hundred words written - pretty pitiful.  Still trying to work out how to get writing done after a brain draining day at work.
