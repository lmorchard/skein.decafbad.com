“Billy,” said Jake, rubbing his hand, “that damn cat bit me!”

“Jake,” said Billy, “what the hell? I told you I’d be right back!”

“It looked like I could grab it by the tail. But, it bit me and ran around the bushes and up a tree out back.”

“Jake, I’m telling you that weren’t no cat.”

“What the hell was it then, huh?”

“I don’t know, but cats ain’t got wings. Or glowing red eyes!”

“It sure howled like it was a cat.”

“Well, hell, I’d howl too if I had a tail and you grabbed it like that!”
